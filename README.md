# QuoraDuuplicateQuestionPair
Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Quora values canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term. so main aim of project is that predicting whether pair of questions are similar or not. This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. Credits: Kaggle
